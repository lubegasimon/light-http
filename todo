- The contents within a given header field value are SHOULD NOT parsed
  unitl a later stage of message interpretation (usually after the message's
  entire header section has been processed)
- Given a header section, extract field name and field value from it by a generic
  field parser.
- No whitespace is allowed between the header field-name and colon.
  A server MUST reject any received request message that contains whitespace
  between a header field-name and colon with a response code of 400 (Bad Request).
- type check headers fields
- string concat [^] is inefficient on long strings, avoid it where necessary
- Improve server logging on incoming requests
- Do away with 'failwith's, introduce exceptions and error handling
