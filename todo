- The contents within a given header field value are SHOULD NOT parsed
  unitl a later stage of message interpretation (usually after the message's
  entire header section has been processed)
- Given a header section, extract field name and field value from it by a generic
  field parser.
- No whitespace is allowed between the header field-name and colon.
  A server MUST reject any received request message that contains whitespace
  between a header field-name and colon with a response code of 400 (Bad Request).
- type check headers fields
- Improve server logging on incoming requests
- Do away with 'failwith's, introduce exceptions and error handling
- Testing; unit testing, integration testing

Performance
-----------
- string concat [^] is inefficient on long strings, avoid it where necessary
- Avoid combination of List.rev & List.flatten

Request
-------
- The origin server should parse the request before constructing a response.
  If the request is malformed, it should return an appropriate error code and
  msg to the client.
- request-uri should be of parsed, use ocaml's `uri` module.
- The absolute path cannot be empty, if note is present in the original
  URI, it MUST be given as "/" (the server root).
- The Request-URI is transmitted in the format specified in section
  3.2.1. If the Request-URI is encoded using the "% HEX HEX" encoding
  [42], the origin server MUST decode the Request-URI in order to
  properly interpret the request. Servers SHOULD respond to invalid
  Request-URIs with an appropriate status code.
